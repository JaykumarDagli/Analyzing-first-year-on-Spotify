# Analyzing-first-year-on-Spotify

Spotify is the most used app on my phone. Since its launch in India last year, this is one app I have used daily and have fallen in awe
of it since the beginning. 

In this project, I am analyzing my listening habits. The top 20 songs, artists and how much time I have spend in the first year of using it.
